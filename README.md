A collection of practical agent skills for software engineering workflows.

## Skills

### code-review

Automated code review that generates persistent **markdown and HTML report files** from git diffs.

**What it does:**

- Analyzes code changes across 5 dimensions: correctness, security, complexity/consistency, maintainability, and language-specific best practices
- Produces date-stamped reports in `.reviews/` (e.g., `2026-04-08_a1b2c3d.md`)
- Optionally generates a styled, self-contained HTML report with severity badges, collapsible findings, and sidebar navigation
- Supports multiple review scopes: staged changes, specific commits, commit ranges, branch comparisons, and PRs
- Includes reference guides for Python and JavaScript/TypeScript best practices

**Example output structure:**

```
.reviews/
├── 2026-04-08_a1b2c3d.md
└── 2026-04-08_a1b2c3d.html
```

### conventional-commit

Splits current working-tree changes into meaningful units and creates one [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)-formatted commit per unit. Optionally pushes after committing, or rewrites recent non-conformant commit history.

**What it does:**

- Groups staged + unstaged changes into logical commits (separates `feat`/`fix`/`docs`/etc. and never combines them)
- Creates each commit with explicit `git add <paths>` — never `git add .`
- Refuses to stage suspected secret files (`.env*`, `*_rsa`, `*.pem`, ...)
- Rewrites non-conformant commit subjects via `git filter-branch`, preserving the original body
- Refuses to rewrite commits already pushed to a remote (safety default)
- Never force-pushes, never bypasses hooks

## Installation

### Using [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) (recommended)

Install all skills from this repo:

```bash
npx skills add chann/skills
```

Install only the `code-review` skill:

```bash
npx skills add chann/skills@code-review
```

Install only the `conventional-commit` skill:

```bash
npx skills add chann/skills@conventional-commit
```

Install globally (available across all projects):

```bash
npx skills add -g chann/skills@code-review
npx skills add -g chann/skills@conventional-commit
```

### Manual installation

Clone and symlink the skill into your Claude Code skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chann/skills.git
cd skills;
ln -s "$(pwd)/code-review" ~/.claude/skills/code-review
ln -s "$(pwd)/conventional-commit" ~/.claude/skills/conventional-commit
```

## Usage

### code-review

Once installed, the skill triggers automatically when you ask Claude Code to review code, or you can use explicit commands:

| Command              | Skill              | Output                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `/code-review`       | `code-review`      | Show findings in conversation (no file)      |
| `/code-review-md`    | `code-review-md`   | Write markdown report to `.reviews/`         |
| `/code-review-html`  | `code-review-html` | Write markdown + HTML reports to `.reviews/` |

**Examples:**

```
> review my changes
> review the last commit
> /code-review-html review staged changes
> /code-review-md review branch feature-auth compared to main
```

### conventional-commit

Triggers when you ask Claude Code to commit your changes, or via explicit commands:

| Command                        | Skill                          | Action                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/conventional-commit`         | `conventional-commit`          | Group staged + unstaged changes into logical units; create one Conventional Commit per unit |
| `/conventional-commit-push`    | `conventional-commit-push`     | Same as above, then `git push` (no force)                                                   |
| `/conventional-commit-rewrite` | `conventional-commit-rewrite`  | Rewrite recent non-conformant commit subjects to Conventional format                        |

**Examples:**

```
> commit my changes
> 변경사항 의미 단위로 커밋해줘
> /conventional-commit-push
> /conventional-commit-rewrite
```

The skill will:

1. Gather the relevant git diff
2. Detect languages and load appropriate best practice references
3. Analyze each changed file for issues
4. Present findings in the conversation, or write report files (depending on command)
5. Show a summary of findings

### Report format

Each report includes:

- **Executive Summary** — files changed, lines added/removed, finding counts, overall risk level
- **Findings** — grouped by severity (CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW), each with file reference, code snippet, and suggested fix
- **Positive Observations** — things the code does well
- **File-by-File Summary** — quick reference table of all changed files and their risk level

### Severity levels

| Level    | Meaning                                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CRITICAL | Data loss, security breach, or crash in production — must fix |
| HIGH     | Bug, vulnerability, or serious design flaw — should fix       |
| MEDIUM   | Code smell, inconsistency, or moderate risk — recommended fix |
| LOW      | Style, naming, minor improvement — nice to have               |
| INFO     | Positive observation or contextual note                       |
